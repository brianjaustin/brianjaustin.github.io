# brianjaustin.github.io

Hello there! :wave: This is the repository for my website/blog.
I don't have plans to publish with any kind of regularity at the moment,
just whenever something strikes me.

The structure, templates, and styles here are heavily based on
[the eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog)
with some of my own tweaks added on top.

If you need to get in touch with me, the best option is

1. non-public channels if you already know me through one of those
2. a discussion or issue on this repository
3. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/b-austin/) for professional things;
   please know that I may not check here often if I am busy at the moment
