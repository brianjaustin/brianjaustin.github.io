title: Bike Infrastructure in the Netherlands

I recently returned from a trip to the Netherlands, and I wanted to document
the bike infrastructure I saw for my local cycling group. The collection is a
little more limited than I'd like, but the cycle paths are _very_ well used,
and I felt a bit awkward taking too many pictures (also my rental bike's phone
holder did not stay in place long enough to get good video ðŸ˜…).

## Separated Bike Lanes

These are probably the most obvious infrastructure components. In the
Netherlands, busier streets like the one below which is right by the
main library -- Bibliotheek Neude -- in Utrecht can typically have car
(and bus) traffic in the centre, then a bike lane (often separated by a
kerb), and finally a sidewalk on the edge.

Here's another example from slightly closer to the main train station, Utrecht
Centraal. Here, there's a small strip for bike parking that separates motor
vehicle traffic from cyclists and pedestrians.

{% image "./utrecht_centrum_fietspad.png", "Picture of a bike path with bicycle parking visible between it and the main road" %}

And, right on the other side of the central station, there's a bike path
going under the rails without a road in sight!

{% image "./utrecht_fietspad_onder_spoor.png", "Picture of a sidewalk and bike path going under a bridge" %}

Even away from the city centre, there are _still_ nice, separated paths:

{% image "./utrecht_bus_auto_fietspad.png", "Picture of a bike path with cars in the next lane over and buses in the high-speed traffic centre lane" %}

{% image "./utrecht_kruispunt_fietspad.png", "Picture of a person on a bicycle going through a roundabout on a separated cycle path" %}

{% image "./utrecht_gewoon_fietspad1.png", "Picture of a separated bicycle path  outside Utrecht city centre" %}

{% image "./utrecht_gewoon_fietspad2.png", "Picture of a separated bicycle path  outside Utrecht city centre" %}

Some of these pictures come from an 11 km cycle to
[Kasteel de Haar](https://www.kasteeldehaar.nl/). On the way back, we also
had the opportunity to bike over a bridge that's shared with a motorway, but
with enough separation to still feel very safe. Pretty neat! (Unfortunately,
that route was quite busy so I didn't have time to stop for any pictures.)

### Other Cities

Utrecht is definitely in its own class in terms of bike usage
([according to the Gemeente](https://www.utrecht.nl/city-of-utrecht/mobility/cycling/),
in 2021 56% of trips to the city centre were by bike, and 94% of residents
own at least one bicycle). However, the other cities I visited --
Den Haag (the Hague), Rotterdam, and Amsterdam -- each had pretty good,
or even fantastic, bike paths of their own.

Rotterdam ([arguably one of the most car-centric cities in The Netherlands](https://youtu.be/22ovt1EMULY?si=GKvoeFfJ6jyg8Rtv)):

Amsterdam:

## Better Intersections

Besides the bicycle paths themselves, when bikes _do_ have to cross with
car traffic, those intersections also feel much more thoughtful.
One of the pictures above (the second of non-city-centre pictures)
shows a bike lane (with right-of-way priority!) through a roundabout.

Here's a pretty big intersection in Amsterdam, which has protected areas
for bikes (even if the traffic pattern is a bit weird):

{% image "./amsterdam_kruispunt.png", "Picture of an intersection with red bike lanes that are separated from the normal asphault road in the middle" %}

Intersections often had separate signals for bikes, which sometimes
even turned green slightly before the others.

{% image "./utrecht_kruispunt_stoplicht.png", "Picture of a bicyclist waiting at an intersection with a specific bicycle stop light" %}

And in one case in Utrecht, where there was significant danger to cyclists from
cars turning right, there was a separate light warning cars to watch out when turning (the picture here isn't great, there's an arrow that moved to show
where motorists needed to look out):

{% image "./utrecht_bijzonder_stoplicht.png", "Picture of two traffic lights, one typical (3-light red/yellow/green) and another with a warning to cars about a bike lane on the right" %}

## Bike Parking

With all the bikes, there need to be places to put them. And oh yes, does the
Netherlands certainly deliver on that!

Bike parking by station Amsterdam Amstel:

{% image "./amsterdam_amstel_fietsenstalling.png", "Large above ground bicicyle parking lot at about 90% capacity" %}

Bike parking lot at Kasteel de Haar (11km from Utrecht city):

{% image "./kasteel_fiestenstalling.png", "Picture of bikes locked up to wooden bike racks" %}

and the bike parking at a farm/restaurant on the way there (actually, this is only about a third to half the number of bicicyles there):

{% image "./boerderij_fietsen.png", "Picture of bicycles parked in a grassy area with trees and farm buildings behind" %}

There's also the _huge_ underground parking garage for bikes at station Utrecht
Centraal:

## Closing

I don't have any particular conclusions about what I saw, other than it was
really pleasant, especially as someone who rarely goes anywhere by car
but does bike and walk a lot. Coming back to the US, the very low
regard for pedestrians (both in terms of infrastructure and motorist
attitudes) was immediately obvious and quite jarring. Hopefully the movement
towards more inclusive cities continues,
[although I'm not particularly hopeful for my own city right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/1azvw8b/mayor_opposed_to_closing_moody_st_to_cars_letter/).
