title: MBTA Commuter Rail Reliability
date: 2024-09-11
---

This post, like my previous one, was prompted by a discussion in my local bike
advocacy group. Some context for people who don't know me in person: I live in a suburb of
Boston, one which is on the [MBTA Commuter Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBTA_Commuter_Rail).
The system is... fine, on paper at least (the 1-hour or worse frequency notwithstanding).
However, as a rider, it feels like the trains are often _very_ behind schedule, to the point
where I expect any train I take into the city to be 10-15 minutes behind schedule.

I am fortunate to not depend on the Commuter Rail most of the time, so I'm curious if my feeling
that the Commuter Rail is almost always delayed comes from a small sample size, or is actually
reflected in the on-time data the MBTA publishes. At some point, I found graphs with that data,
but I can't track it down anymore. I _did_ find some raw data though, so I thought I'd try
making my own graphs.

The dataset I'm using comes from
[the MBTA data portal](https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b3a24561c2104422a78b593e92b566d5_0/explore).
Unfortunately, it only includes up to Q2 of June 2024, and there is this caveat in the description

> IMPORTANT: The Rail reliability metric is under revision; current metric
> is available until May 2024. The data will be backfilled once the metric
> is revised.

Also worth noting, trains on the Commuter Rail are considered "on time" if they arrive within 5
minutes of the scheduled time (according to the
[MBTA Service Delivery Policy](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2021-06/2021-service-delivery-policy.pdf), page 24).

But enough stalling, here are the graphs!

My overall impression is that the Commuter Rail is consistently inconsistent. Which isn't
particularly great. ðŸ˜ž Of course, these graphs don't reflect the delay _magnitude_,
which is also important. I looked in the MBTA dataset, though, and unfortunately it seems
that the "passgener wait time" metric is not provided for the Commuter Rail.

Either way, I think the the Commuter Rail could do better.
